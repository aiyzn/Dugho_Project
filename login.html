		<div class="intro">
		<p>The aim of this advocacy is to be able to help people in need and those of our generation build a better future for themselves. The Philippines itself is one of the countries that rank quite high within the charts of the countries with high unemployment rates. It is disheartening to see that people struggle to provide for their families due to them being unable to get proper jobs. Thus, this advocacy is about stopping that through providing the people with proper resources so that they can be able to provide for what their family needs.</p>
